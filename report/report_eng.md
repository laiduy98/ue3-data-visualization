# Nadia's report.
## Presentation.

One of the things that I loved the most in this presentation was the slides.
I found them very interesting and very well organized which made me focus and not get bored at all. Also, the fact that they added all the important visual representations of what they were saying without making it seem crowded or confusing, shows how much effort and time they took to make these beautiful slides.

## Oral Presentation.

Generally speaking, it was pretty easy to follow and understand the story, except in some parts where I had to listen carefully because I was quite confused.
The girls presented such a complex crime in a very easy-to-follow way and divided their parts equally which made it smooth to the listener.
The story of Megumi Yokota is very sad and opens our eyes to what happens in this world, so I am grateful for the girls to share it with us as it was my first time hearing about this tragedy.
The group lacks when it comes to interacting with the listeners, as they didn’t try to involve us in the story or to ask any questions about our opinion.. which led to some moments where I digressed.
But overall it was good, especially that in the post-presentation discussion we could notice that the girls really know about this subject as they answered all the questions even the ones including new or additional information.

## What could the group do better in the future?

Overall, I liked the presentation which made finding an answer to this question quite hard, but if I had to choose something I'd say their way of speaking/presenting, as it seemed a little bit stiff therefore it made them appear less prepared, which turned out to be wrong as they answered all the questions very well and very confidently.



# Duy’s report.
## Presentation:

The presentation was very eye-catching. The theme was appropriate with the story that the group told. I think it was gonna be a very interesting story before the group even started. The storyline of the presentation was reasonable with multiple highlights that made the audiences interested and not boring.

The information on the slide was very comprehensive. They used a lot of images and references a lot to make the slide more attractive and made audiences focus on the main storyline.

## Oral Presentation.

With the oral part of the presentation, we can easily catch the main idea of the presentation. They had a wide variety of grammar and lexical resources. However, some parts of the presentation still make the audience feel a little bit reading. They can easily improve that in the future.

After their presentation, I found myself very curious about the story and I wanted to read more about it on the internet. It was a very good story.

## What could the group do better in the future?

The presentation overall was smooth, logical and had a storyline attached to it. I think the group could be more prepared with sudden questions from audiences and could flex more in the way they told the story. 

They could create more contact with classmates, making questions more to the audiences after the presentation finished to create a joyful atmosphere.



# Zilu’s report.
## Presentation.

I would like to express my feelings about this presentation which mainly focuses on Siham's part.
Firstly, Siham introduces megumi's background and her family situation; she is an ordinary Japanese girl high school student who lives in the north of Japan but never came back after one visit to school.
Secondly, in terms of exposition, Siham's presentation is relatively clear, as she shows in detail some important points in time in her slides, such as:
- The 15th of november 1977 - Megumi's disappearance
- The 12th of august 1978 - the disappearance of a couple: Rumiko and Shuichi
- The 7th of January 1980 -  a foreign intelligence service involved 
In addition to that, Siham's section served to set the stage for the whole presentation, and she did a good job of sparking my curiosity about the story.
Overall, Siham gave a clear chronological background to the story and the audience was able to listen to the story in a more focused manner.

## Oral Presentation.

Regarding the oral presentation, I was able to follow her presentation and get the relevant information with ease. In terms of grammar, there was also not much of a problem, although given the difficulty of the first part, it was really not easy to make mistakes compared to others. Furthermore, I liked the logic of her exposition through two different cases of disappearances and finally linking them to the possible abduction of these victims by external forces, which made me want to understand where the story was going.
 
However, it would have been nice to have some interaction with the group on the link between part 1 and part 2, and it would have been nice to see the speaker's face during the presentation, but this is a disadvantage of distance courses, which is understandable.
 
All in all, I liked the presentation of the story and the style of their slides, with an overall black tone and yellow and white font, which was simple and clean and allowed the audience to get the information better. They clearly talk about a heartbreaking story by dividing the whole story into three parts, and as a listener I could relate to this.

## What could the group do better in the future?

As mentioned earlier, overall I enjoyed their topic and presentation. However, it did manage to feel more like a reading than a natural way of talking, as well as perhaps missing some interaction with audiences. Other than that it was very good and I am grateful to them for presenting the story.

# Wessal’s report.
## Presentation.

The subject of the presentation was very interesting and generally well represented and organized. Each slide contains specific information, but without making it crowded or heavy to understand, also adding the pictures makes it more interesting and engaging because we could see how the real characters look like. They used plain and clear language so it helps us to read, understand the information clearly.

## Oral Presentation.

I like the fact that it was a very complex storyline, but they succeed in making it easy to follow. The story was very intriguing and I was shocked to know that north Corean used to kidnap Japanese people for their own political benefit, the story caught my intention that I even searched for more similar cases to try to learn more about ulterior motives.                                                                                                                     In general the presentation was well done, but I would prefer if they were more engaging with the audience and try to know our opinion about the story.

## What could the group do better in the future?

During the presentation it felt like they were  reading from a script so I think in the future they could  try to be  mindful of the natural cadences and rhythms of spontaneous speech, and make sure to apply them throughout the presentation. Also, I would recommend activating the video camera so we can see their facial expression because the non-verbal cues are an essential part of communication also being seen just simply holds people accountable for being engaged in the session instead of zoning out.

# Masha’s report. 

## Presentation(design part).

The presentation from the design point of view was very good and captivating. It was very easy to follow the slides. It’s important to mention that an oral presentation was working well with the presentation itself. Illustrations helped a lot with the visualizing part, as for the audience it’s very important to see faces of people, flags, maps etc. in order to create their own image of the story. Creating this type of image, while giving the presentation – is a very hard job and the group succeeded in that. We saw the story and this gave us an opportunity to be more empathic to it. For example, at the end of the presentation there are two pictures of Megumi to compare. Having this we can create our own analysis of a situation and guess whether the adult version of the Megumi is the real one. A little mind game for an audience – why not? To conclude, I would like to point out the style of the presentation: it’s very classy with no deviation from the theme and neon touches, in my opinion it was a small reference to a japanese culture. From the design point of view – the work was done on the highest level.


## Oral Presentation.

Having the story being extremely interesting and shocking, the oral part of the presentation was a little bit confusing. The girls mostly read the text and because of that it was a little bit hard to follow. However, the structure of the presentation was very good. In my opinion, it’s great that the other examples of abduction were presented to the audience. In addition to that, as I already mentioned, the story is very interesting and important to know. The group made a good choice with this topic because it is very unique and political. So while sometimes it was a little bit hard to follow because of the reading thing, the story itself was so good that it was still interesting to listen to. The most shocking part for me was the fact that somehow the government can control our bodies without our will. I was starting to wonder: do we have the full rights to our bodies or being a citizen we unwillingly give control to the government we live in? And how can we get out of this? 
Having so many questions about politics, bodies, our rights after the presentation was given, made me realize that girls raised a very important topic that can lead to very interesting discussions. This being said, despite little grammar mistakes and the reading part, the oral part and the structure of the presentation was very promising. 

## What could the group do better in the future?

As was already mentioned, the reading part of the presentation could be improved to the talking part. It will be very interesting to listen to what girls are thinking about this situation with Magumi: their personal opinion on that, thoughts and feelings. Also, in future it will be interesting to add some political/sociological optics: why they abducted so many girls, why the government has control of our bodies, were there attempts to stop these horrifying movements and why not so many people do not know about that? Having these questions asked, can help create the engagement  between the presenters and the audience and follow to very interesting discussions. 


# Kenza’s report.

## Presentation.

The presentation design was really beautiful, the colors blended well, not blinding. Regarding the content of the slides, there was not a lot of text so it allowed us to follow especially with the photos which attracted and it made us curious so we were not at all bored.


## Oral presentation.

The story that the girls present us was really fascinating, I had never heard of it, they popularized it and explained it well, they gave us a lot of information about Megumi, her entourage, the circumstances of her kidnapping , the misfortune of her family and especially her father who died before seeing him again, the group has also prioritized the events of the story which made it very easy to understand.
The only point that I noted that remains to be improved by the group is the lack of debate at the end of their presentation, in the sense that the girls could have engaged the other students to participate in a debate and I think that that would have led to us expanding the story and having more information.
Finally, I think the presentation was enriching for everyone, because we were given a lot of relevant information and we learned new things.

## What could the group do better in the future?

In my opinion, the presentation of Amira, Neila and Siham was well done overall whether it was the design, the information they gave and the story itself, if there is just one small remark what I could do for them in order to do better in the future, it would be to involve the audience and debate the subject, also read a little less but rather express themselves as they see fit.
